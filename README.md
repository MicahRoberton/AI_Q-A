# AI_Q-A
This Python program allows the user to type in a question to a Search function. This question is then run through Wolfram Alpha (A computational knowledge engine) and then Wikipedia (an online encyclopedia) if it still can't find an answer to generate a text response. An example could be asking "Who is the US President" will return the current president's name.
